Project to design a basic bot net that finds a certain IoT device and install software to scan and locate other vulnerable IoT devices of the same make.

Research viability of this attack as well as explore resources on available IoT devices.

Requirements:
1) Locate accessible IoT device <- successful but confused and switched direction
2) Simulate a local network with device <- Turned into a main focus and proved amazingly educational for me
3) Find vulnerability and gain access to device <- worked this out for a linux based system assumed default passwords
4) Download software onto the device <- iffy but would likely work with a linux system
5) Use device to scan for other devices <- if nmpa can be instaled this is cake
6) Try and use this device to another device on the same network <- should work well

I realized I kinda of just jumbled my files in here and didn't do a great job of explained much of it. I just uploaded a close out document that formats the final product for this project as well as how I want to continue moving forward and after the semestrer.

Lastly I want to clairify on the final project. A few weeks ago I decided I needed to simplify what I was doing for myself because I was confused and discouraged. I switched to all local hosted with machines. This final product is still geared on attacking IoT devices. We are assuming we are just going to scan the web for certain device IDs or IPs and once we find them we will attempt to gain root access via known pass word or from a dictionary. We can then structure out botnet this way and use them as an attack platform.
