// The source code is reall interesting but I don't feel like I have a proper understanding of the code nor the code base to want to run or deploy it. I think it does serve as a great example as well as good research on what my aim should be.

// This was pretty big for me even know the article was simple it made me realise that I should focus on making my C@C and from there atempt to create the botnet from there. This is due to the need for this to give directions to the botnet.

NOTE: I have recieved a Lynksys router that is linux capable. Depending on what I decide I need I may try and use this to simulate my botnet instead of an IOT device to make thinks simpler

// I am currently reading and working through this. Once I have a useable product and code I will be uploading this.
